# Cyber Security System Engineering - Final Project

This repository contains the resources for analyzing security and privacy threats in disaster relief systems. The project focuses on integrating robust cybersecurity measures into disaster response architectures.

## Project Overview

- **Scenario:**  
  Addressing communication failures in disaster scenarios (e.g., flooding, earthquakes) where traditional channels are unavailable.

- **Key Focus Areas:**  
  - **Security Architecture:** Applying frameworks like PASTA/OCTAVE for threat analysis and system hardening.  
  - **Privacy Architecture:** Employing LINDDUN to ensure data privacy throughout the system lifecycle.

## Deliverables

1. **Security Architecture Report:**  
   - Detailed system design and threat mitigation using security threat modeling techniques.
   
2. **Privacy Architecture Report:**  
   - Updated system design incorporating privacy enhancing measures based on LINDDUN methodology.

Both reports conform to the IEEE template and include a comprehensive analysis of system vulnerabilities, controls, and architecture refinements.
